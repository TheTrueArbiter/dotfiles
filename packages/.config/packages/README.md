# Package Installer

Purpose: package installer script.

This is script is currently a work in progress. Please use with caution.

## TODO 

1) simplfy code in package-installer.sh --> create an input function and call it
in methods that needed it.

2) Check if packages need to be orgranized in certain order to ensure that packags 
that depende on other packages are installed first. Example would be to make sure that
yay is installed before installing packges that need yay to be installed
